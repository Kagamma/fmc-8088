# fmc-8088

A modification of Faust Music Creator, allows it to be used on IBM PC compatible computers.

Based on the source code at https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=62121, what I did was make a small modification that allows the program to display text cursor properly on CGA card, thus enabling the use of the program as an Adlib OPL2 tracker on 8088 machine.

The binary is included in the repo.
