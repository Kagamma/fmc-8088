# fmc-8088

A modification of Faust Music Creator, allows it to be used on IBM PC compatible computers.

Based on the source code at https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=62121, what I did was make a small modification that allows the program to display the text cursor properly on a CGA card, thus enabling the use of the program as a tracker on an 8088 machine.

The binary is included in the repo.
